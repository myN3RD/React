- React is a Frontend-Framework
- React is component-based and state-driven
- its a JS library

- with React we never touch the DOM



ðŸ‘‰ React (Documentation that you should keep open at all times)

ðŸ‘‰ Create React App (This is how we'll setup our first app)

ðŸ‘‰ Vite: Getting Started (For real-world React apps)

ðŸ‘‰ Adding React URL to an HTML Document (For the "Pure React" lecture)


REACT is all about:

components:

- components are building blocks of UI (button, inputs fields etc.)










A Frontend Framework is there for keeping the frontend/UI in sync with the data. -> (with plain vanilla JS this is way to hard)

"DATA synchronizing with the UI"


Frontend Frameworks enforce us to write code in a STRUCTURED way ("structured apps")



- Piece of date = Piece of state





Conceps: 

Most fundamental concept of react = STATE

Whenever wie change something in the UI ->  we use STATE





Effect : ...


"In React we try to devide UI into components"

A Convention in React is to name comonents in UpperCase!
