- React is a Frontend-Framework
- React is component-based and state-driven
- its a JS library (actually so, its no framework)

NOTE: before learning NEXT.js -> React learning has to be done 

- with React we never touch the DOM (there is where we use STATE)


A Frontend Framework is there for keeping the frontend/UI in sync with the data. -> (with plain vanilla JS this is way to hard)

"DATA synchronizing with the UI"


Frontend Frameworks enforce us to write code in a STRUCTURED way ("structured apps")



👉 React (Documentation that you should keep open at all times)

👉 Create React App (This is how we'll setup our first app)

👉 Vite: Getting Started (For real-world React apps)

👉 Adding React URL to an HTML Document (For the "Pure React" lecture)



          2 WAYS TO SETUP A REACT PROJECT
          _______________________________


CREATE-REACT-APP                         VITE
________________                         ____

❌ not recommended for           ✅ for real-world projects
real-world projects

✅ (just for learning)




          CREATING A NEW REACT APP
          ________________________

1. Terminal
2. go to the folder, where the app should be
3. command  in terminal: npx create-react-app@5 folder-name  // @5 is maybe not neccessary



REACT is all about:
___________________


          COMPONENTS
          __________

"In React we try to devide UI into components"

- components are building blocks of UI (button, inputs fields etc.)












- Piece of date = Piece of state





          CONCEPS
          _______

STATE
_____

Most fundamental concept of react = STATE

Whenever we change something in the UI ->  we use STATE

NOTE:

we never touch the DOM with React







Effect : ...



A Convention in React is to name comonents in UpperCase!
